So this is not as much as documentation as just a quick overview how to use this tool.

This pokemon tracker was made specifically to track pokemon for Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, and has only those pokemon available. A full version containing all 900+ pokemon is in the works.

In order to update a slot, you need to click the radio button next to it. Any activity on a slot will always occur on the radio button.

Click on the button, then tap on the pokemon's icon you wish to load. Fill in the details in the form as needed.
Once all the pokemon are set, you can click the update roster button, which will populate the information into the actual animated roster at the top of the page.

When a slot is active, you can click 'clear slot' to quickly remove the details of that slot. I never coded anything to clear out the details from the top, so that functionality doesn't exist. You're not doing anything wrong that's not making it work.

When a slot is selected, clip copy of the slot who's  information you want to import to change the information in the current slot. It *will* erase all info if you hit copy from an empty slot.

That's the basics of how it works. The code is commented somewhat, but I never planned to share this project so it's not as highly commented as the other code that will be uploaded once its done. But I know you all wanted to poke around and see how it works, so please enjoy.

Feel free to play with this. feel free to use it as a basis for whatever you're doing. All I ask is you credit me as spacedogprincess or my twitter @ziaellithiel if you do use this in your projects. Go Ham!

Also if you do have questions, feel free to @ me on twitter! I'm more than happy to respond to questions!
